# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
To complete this project, I followed a structured approach that involved creating a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - I began by setting up the project's HTML structure to create the game board, mode selection (human or computer), and elements for displaying messages and the score.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - I implemented the core game logic, allowing players to take turns and make moves by clicking on the grid cells. To prevent further interaction with marked cells, I added a "no-hover" class.
   - I created a function to check for a winner by evaluating winning combinations. If a player wins, I display a message and update the score.

3. **Player Switching:**
   - I ensured that the game alternates between players (X and O) after each valid move, creating an engaging competitive experience.

4. **Restart Feature:**
   - I added a restart button to reset the game board and allow users to start a new game. This involved clearing the cells, resetting the current player to X, and indicating that the game is not over.

5. **Game Modes:**
   - I introduced the choice of playing against a human or the computer, providing radio buttons to select the desired mode. In computer mode, the computer AI makes random moves.

6. **Score Tracking:**
   - I implemented a scoreboard to keep track of the score for both players (X and O). The score updates whenever a winner is determined.

7. **Responsive Design:**
   - I ensured that the game is visually appealing and responsive by styling it with CSS. Winning cells are highlighted for a better user experience.

8. **User Experience:**
   - To make the game engaging and user-friendly, I incorporated features like clear messages, a smooth player switch, and a delay for the computer's move to enhance gameplay.

The result is an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that offers multiple game modes, keeps track of scores, and provides a complete gaming experience. The code is well-organized and adheres to best practices for web development.
